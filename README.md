# Photocomic

The Photocomic App pulls comics from XKCD and displays them in the top half of the screen while also displaying the safe_title of the comic in the center of the screen. Based on this title, I have pulled and parsed the JSON from Flickr to display a relevant image in the bottom half of the screen. The user can press Next to see more comics and related Flickr images or press Prev to see the previous comic and a related Flickr image.
